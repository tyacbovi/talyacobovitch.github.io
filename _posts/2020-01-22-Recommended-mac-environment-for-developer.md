title: Recommended Mac environment for developers
---

There are a lot of cool applications, tools and computer magic tricks (really a lot (smile)).

So from my experience, these are the recommended for developers on a Mac machine (even some of those also for Ubuntu).

Text Editor
-----------

* Atom - An IDE with a lot of community open plugins, really there are for anything you will ever need.
* VScode - Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
Shell.

Custom shells
-------------

* Fish shell - is a smart and user-friendly command line with a very comfortable auto-suggesting ability, instructions how to customize it.
* z: z - jump around, and a fish compatible version z for fish shell.
* fzf: A command-line fuzzy finder.
* thefuck: Magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.

Python
------

* virtualenvwrapper - wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies. And for who that uses fish shell use this virtualfish
* pipenv - is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. Without the feature of switching virtual envs.
* IDE's - 
    * Pycharm - Creating virtualenv via your IDE, not the most comfortable way but can be useful.

Git Commandline
---------------

Macro for git commands guide - Setting terminal macros for git commands, if for simplifying complex git commands or easy to remember commands.
Setting up git graph - A command line option to show a git repo history graph.
Extension to working with github - A command line that supply command line access to all github interface.
