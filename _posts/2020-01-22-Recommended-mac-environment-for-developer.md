title: Recommended Mac environment for developers
---

There are a lot of cool applications, tools and computer magic tricks (really a lot!!).

![](../images/the_matrix_gun_rack.jpg)

So from my experience, these are recommended for developers on a Mac machine (even some of those also for Ubuntu).

Note: There some recommendations which are not free, they will be marked as :neutral_face:.

Package Manager
---------------

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - A package manager for Mac, a very basic tool and a must-have for daily use.

Custom Terminal
---------------

* [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) - For a nicer and more comfortable terminal iTerm is recommended, and for guake like experience (drop down terminal) please refer to [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30850430/iterm2-hide-show-like-guake).


Custom Shells
-------------

* [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) - is a smart and user-friendly command line with a very comfortable auto-suggesting ability, instructions [how to customize it](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#tut_startup).
* [z](https://github.com/rupa/z): jump around, and a fish compatible version [z for fish shell](https://github.com/fisherman/z).
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): A command-line fuzzy finder.
* [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck): Magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.

Text Editor
-----------

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - An IDE with a lot of [community open plugins](https://atom.io/packages), really there are for anything you will ever need.
* [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
Shell.

Git Commandline
---------------

* [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) - A very useful git GUI, that enables all most used git commands in a very comfortable and clear UI.
* [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) - hub is a command line tool that wraps git in order to extend it with extra features and commands that make working with GitHub easier. That allows something cool like 'goto' command (='hub browse') from a git repo, that will open the browser on that repo in the current branch
* [Macro for git commands guide](https://githowto.com/aliases) - Setting terminal macros for git commands, if for simplifying complex git commands or easy to remember commands.
* [Setting up git graph](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graphs-and-git/visualizing-your-git-repository.html) - A command line option to show a git repo history graph.
* [Extension to working with github](https://github.com/github/hub) - A command line that supplies command line access to all GitHub interface.

Python
------

* [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies. And for who that uses fish shell use this [virtualfish](https://github.com/adambrenecki/virtualfish).
* [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) - is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. Without the feature of switching virtual envs.
* IDE's - 
    * [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm-edu/creating-virtual-environment.html) - Creating virtualenv via your IDE, not the most comfortable way but can be useful.

Notes
-----

Note keeping, there are a lot of options out there, a couple of the best:
* [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) - Very easy-to-use with a lot of abilities (Dividing to categories, reminders by time or location and a lot more), Android Apple (iOS OSX) clients are available.
* [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/) - Also very easy to use, and sync perfectly with all your Apple devices and can incorporate code snippets.

Quick Actions
-------------

* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - At is basic core abilities, it is similar to spotlight. But can be greatly extended with plugins, like phrase shortcuts and etc. :neutral_face:

Custom Touch Action
-------------------

[BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) -  Allows you to customize various input devices (touchpad, apple mouse or key sequence) on your Mac. Not free :neutral_face:

I will update my recommandtions along the way, there will always be something cooler and new in the future.
Until next time :)
