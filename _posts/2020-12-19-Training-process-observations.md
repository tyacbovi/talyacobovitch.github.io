Introduction
------------
Recently I have started to work for a new company, which included going through a training process and I was requested to give feedback on it. That made me reflect on "what makes a training process a good one?" for the trainee and trainer (not in sport talk employee and employer) and what is actually a “good training process”, by thinking about all the previous training processes that I have been through.
I been through 3 complete training processes and more than 5 specific team training, and I had the chance to write 2 complete and 3 team specific training processes for multiple developers disciples. And along the way, I noticed what worked for me and what seems to work for others from my perspective.

“Good training process” what do you mean?
-----------------------------------------
Before getting to what includes a "good training" we need to define it's goals, without this of course we can not see if we are heading the right way.
And well this’s a pretty hard question to answer, when you think about it and a very subjective one. So let’s start at looking on a simpler question of what we want to gain from a training process, as I see it the big picture targets are:
* Gain an effective team member (task wise) as the best person in the team (from the first second after the training of course).
* The training process should happen in the shortest time frame as possible (for obvious reasons).
* Gain a team member socially wise, we want the new person to fit in because that will help to make the workplace nicer to be in. Which will likely improve collaboration and in turn could improve productivity.

In most cases from my experience, most people will not reach those high in the sky goals after any training. Because of several reasons:
* People don’t like long training, so they tend to rush to finish the tasks even if they don’t really finish just to mark it as done and to make a good impression at the new company/team.
* People cannot remember everything that they learn in the training, and in most cases, the important info to remember is not pointed out to them or what they should not remember.
* Set clear and transparent goals for the training from the trainee, like gain basic knowledge in a new lang vs learn these X topics in that lang, not clear ex (like giving a ex to write an http server that does some logic, but the trainee spend most of the time to raise the server then focusing on writing the logics). NOTE to self: this point needs clear examples that will make the point.

As I see it these should be the goals of the training:
* Knows where to look for info, and not just his closest team member.
* Knows who and how to ask questions (TODO: probably not relevant because this is not important in the training level).
* Understand the team’s code flow, for example when giving a bug knows where to start looking (which could be the wrong place).
* Can do simple tasks, quick wins, grunt work at least
* Can understand team design docs
* Knows what is the basic workflow in the team, for example scrum and things alike
* Feeling able and understand the motivation to keep the docs and training up to date.
* Takes initiative and feel safe too, passion is important
* Ideally team member socially.

Observations
------------

Training planning
*****************
* Each training step should have a clearly stated learning goal, like "getting to know framework X" or "getting familiar with workflow". In order to know what is cover in the training and manage the coverage (like the unit test coverage of a code repo).
* Every training subject should have an exercise to showcase it, so the trainee will get his "hands dirty" and raise questions early on. Of course one exercise can cover more than one subject, so you will not end up with a lot of exercises which will tire your hard working trainee.
* Different seniority levels require different knowledge levels, so design accordingly which could mean having more exercises or even different ones probably with the same core.
* Allow trainees to do things in their own style, like: doing tasks linear or in parallel or learning visually/reading/writing. So they could start to see how their work style will fit in the team (or not which could mean for them to adapt to it).
* Clear roadmap for the trainee and range of time for each task, so they could raise a flag that they need help or you will notice that. By this they will learn that it’s ok to raise a flag. Also people tend to think that they are late and that they are drill too much into subjects
* The training process mostly should be a self serve with the buddies support (see the clause about buddies).
* More than one person (trainee) in the process in the same or close stages, and also more than one technical person for a wider view and opinions of the system (will lead to better new ideas from the new guy/women).

During Training
***************
* Basic code examples - reduce the amount of boiler code, for example there is no point to make someone write an http server from scratch. Choose what you want the trainee to learn, maybe go through the template
* Check-in with the trainee to see it’s progress via the buddy or the instructor, but in a longer periods (so the trainees will have a chance to complete tasks even small ones and feel they are making progress) in order to accustom them to a normal team workflow.
* The trainee at the end of the training should learn where to look (google, wiki or the person next door) and how+when to choose which one.
* Using as much as possible prod development standard (and probably you should have one :) ) in every ex, toy ex are not interesting and will slow the progress
* If you have a code style in use, it should be applied from the first second. If a trainee can go to several teams in the company that have different style guides, in my view don't put the little mistakes on focus because it's a matter of an opinions (Ideally this should be a cross company *one* standard from internal mobility concerns).
* *Everything* should be in the Wiki, constantly updating it which means that every time someone needs information will look firstly in the wiki, if there is none then ask and update the wiki himself/herself or open a task with priority high.
* Training instructor, buddy, the "go to person" for question (for any kind, social or technical) does not have to know everything but can point to the right place to seek answers. So it's important to choose the right people in terms of knowledge and character for the success of the process.
* Incorporate as much as possible production “real” tasks as a part of the training in service of the ideal of "first day an effective team member".

After Training
**************
* Learning from first hand experience trainees, team members, buddies and team leader at different time points. For example, at the end of the training and after six months so you could see:
  * What was relevant or not to learn in the sense that the trainee had used it at least more then once after the training.
  * What was not enough, overlocked or needs to be preserve as is.
  * What was different from the actual teams practices.
  Always improve the training cycle, because "the only constant is change" (not my quote, but believe in it fully) which comes to expression by for example changing training plan and the actual trainees background which is not the same.

Conclusions
-----------
I don’t think there is a silver bullet, like everything in the programming world there is more than one way to do things (and that’s what makes this fun and interesting to do :) ), but I think there are a couple of basic big ideas that will increase the chances for a successful training process according to your view:
* Design the process, as a whole down to it’s to the basic exercises (knots and bullets), in sight of your training's goals.
* Manage your goals down to earth, to the level of achievable targets and leave room for surprises.
* Always take feedback from trainees and other stack holders (team leader of the trainee, team members and buddies).
Let me know what you think.

Until next time :)
