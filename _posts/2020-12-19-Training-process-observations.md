Introduction
------------
Recently I have participated in a training process in a new company, and at the end of it, I was requested to give feedback on it. Which made me reflect on what makes a training process a good one for the trainee and trainer (employee and employer) and what is actually a “good training process”, by thinking about all the previous training processes that I have been through.
Which were 3 complete training processes and more than 4 specific team training and I had the chance to wrote 2 full training processes for multiple target developers disciples. And along the way, I noticed what worked for me and what seems to work for others.

“Good training process” what do you mean?
-----------------------------------------
Well, that’s a pretty hard question to answer, when you really think about it and a really subjective one. Let’s start at looking at a simpler question of what we want to gain from a training process, as I see it the big picture ideal targets are:
Gain an effective team member (task wise) as the best person in the team (from the first second after the training of course).
The training process should happen in the shortest time frame as possible (for obvious reasons).

In most cases from my experience, most people will not reach those high in the sky goals after any training. Because of several reasons:
People don’t like long training, so they tend to speed up finishing tasks even if they don’t really finish just to mark it as done and to make a good impression for the new company/team.
People cannot remember everything that they learned in the training, and in most cases, the important info to remember is not spelled out to them or what they should not remember.
Clear goals for the training from the trainee, like gain basic knowledge in a new lang vs learn these X topics in that lang, not clear ex (like giving a ex to write an http server that does some logic, but the trainee spend most of the time to raise the server then focusing on writing the logics). NOTE to self: this point needs clear examples that will make the point.

So in my mind this should be the goal of the training:
Knows where to look for info, and not just his closest team member.
Understand the team’s code flow, for example when giving a bug knows where to start looking (ofc probably that place will be wrong)
Can do simple tasks, quick wins, grunt work at least
Can understand team design docs
Knows what is the basic workflow in the team, for example scrum and things alike
Feeling able and understand the motivation to keep the docs and training up to date.
Takes initiative and feel safe too, passion is important

Observations
------------
TODO: divide it to topics
Every training step should have an ex to showcase it
Using from the first second a code style guide
Everything is in the Wiki, constantly updating it (every time someone needs some info will look in the wiki, if there is none then ask and update the wiki or open a task with priority high)
The process mostly should be self serve
Training instructor, buddy, go to person for question (for any kind, social or technical, not have to be a single person)
Each training step should have a clearly stated learning goal
Learning from trainees, always improving the training cycle
Incorporating as much as possible production “real” tasks as a part of the training
Clear roadmap for the trainee and range of time for each task, so they could raise a flag that they need help or you will notice that. By this they will learn that it’s ok to raise a flag. Also people tend to think that they are late and that they are drill too much into subjects
More than one person (trainee) in the process in the same or close stages, and also more than one technical person for a wider view and opinions of the system (will lead to better new ideas from the new guy/women).
Using as much as possible prod development standard (and probably you should have one :) ) in every ex, toy ex are not interesting and will slow the progress
Allow trainee to do things in his own style, like doing things linear or in parallel, learning visually/reading/writing
Basic code examples - reduce the amount of boiler code, for example there is no point to make someone write an http server from scratch. Choose what you want the trainee to learn, maybe go through the template
Design to skill level, could have more ex or different ones. But with the same core
The trainee at the end of the training should leran where to look (google, wiki or the person next door) and how+when to choose which one.
Check in with the trainee to see it’s progress, but not in scrum like and do daily
If there is team training and basis training, leave the heavy technical stuff for the team.

Conclusions
-----------
I don’t think there is a silver bullet, like everything in the programming world there is more than one way to do things (that’s what this makes fun and interesting :) ), but I think there are a couple of basic big ideas that will increase the chances for a successful training process according to your view:
Design the process, as a whole down to it’s ex,  in sight of your training objectives
Always take feedback from trainees and other stack holders (team leader of the trainee, team members and buddies),
Manage your main goals down to earth that is achievable.

Until next time :)
