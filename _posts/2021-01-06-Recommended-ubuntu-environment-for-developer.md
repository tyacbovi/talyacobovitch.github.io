title: Recommended Ubuntu environment for developers
---

There are a lot of cool applications, tools and computer magic tricks (really a lot!!).

![](../images/the_matrix_gun_rack.jpg)

So from my experience, these are recommended for developers on a Ubuntu machine.

Note: There some recommendations which are not free, they will be marked as :neutral_face:.

Customizing Terminal
--------------------

* [guake](http://guake-project.org/) - A quick access (by shortcut) and nicer terminal experience please check this out.


Custom Shells
-------------

* [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) - is a smart and user-friendly command line with a very comfortable auto-suggesting ability, instructions [how to customize it](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#tut_startup).
* [z](https://github.com/rupa/z): jump around, and a fish compatible version [z for fish shell](https://github.com/fisherman/z).
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): A command-line fuzzy finder.
* [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck): Magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.

Text Editor
-----------

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - An IDE with a lot of [community open plugins](https://atom.io/packages), really there are for anything you will ever need.
* [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
Shell.

Git Commandline
---------------

* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - A very useful git GUI, that enables all most used git commands in a very comfortable and clear UI.
* [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) - hub is a command line tool that wraps git in order to extend it with extra features and commands that make working with GitHub easier. That allows something cool like 'goto' command (='hub browse') from a git repo, that will open the browser on that repo in the current branch
* [Macro for git commands guide](https://githowto.com/aliases) - Setting terminal macros for git commands, if for simplifying complex git commands or easy to remember commands.
* [Setting up git graph](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graphs-and-git/visualizing-your-git-repository.html) - A command line option to show a git repo history graph.

Python
------

* [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies. And for who that uses fish shell use this [virtualfish](https://github.com/adambrenecki/virtualfish).
* [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) - is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. Without the feature of switching virtual envs.
* IDE's - 
    * [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm-edu/creating-virtual-environment.html) - Creating virtualenv via your IDE, not the most comfortable way but can be useful.

Notes
-----

Note keeping, there are a lot of options out there, I love to use:
* [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) - Very easy-to-use with a lot of abilities (Dividing to categories, reminders by time or location and a lot more), Android Apple (iOS OSX) clients are available.


I will update my recommendations along the way, there will always be something cooler and new in the future.
Until next time :)
